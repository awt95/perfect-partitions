A tool for calculating round partition sizes

This tool is simple but useful for me.

A desperately simple tool for calculating round partition sizes
That is to say, to calculate the required size for a partition of exactly 25.00GB in size
Specifically written for Windows and the Disk Management utility

For example, if you would like a partition to be exactly 500.00GB in size,
then you would use a partition of size 512001 MB (in Disk Management).
